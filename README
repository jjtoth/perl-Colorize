Colorize version 0.0.1

Colorize is intended to give colorization without worrying about what the
colors "ought" to be.  Use Term::ANSIColors for that.

Example:

    use Colorize;

    print for map { colorize($_) . " " } 
        qw(This isn't a good example but it's an example anyway);
    print "\n"

will print all the words in their own color (so the two "example"'s will be
given the same color).

We assume that you have a terminal that supports 256 colors.  That said, after
assigning 200ish colors, we start back at the begining.  (Using different
backgrounds is a future feature).

At present, we

    colorize("thing");

Gives "thing" it's own unique color and surrounds it with the proper ANSI
codes.

    colorize("relevant","everything here");

Colorizes "everything here" based on the unique color for "relevant".

color_code_for("thing")
    Returns the ANSI code we've assigned to "thing".
